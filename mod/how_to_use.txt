How to Use
The modularized code maintains the same functionality but is now more organized. To use it:

Set up the directory structure as shown in the README
Create the necessary init.py files in each directory
Install the dependencies using the setup.py script
Run main.py as before

You can also extend individual modules more easily now. For example, if you want to add a new visualization, you just need to create a new file in the visualization/ directory without touching the rest of the code.

upgrades:

I've now completed the integration of all your additional code modules into our modularized structure! Here's what I've added:
New Modules

Enhanced Data Handling:

data/enhanced.py: Efficient multi-ticker data fetching, safe downloading, and metadata retrieval
data/multi_asset.py: Support for currencies, ETFs, and multi-asset reporting


Extended Analysis:

analysis/dividend.py: Dividend history analysis and bid-ask spread tracking


New Visualizations:

visualization/currency.py: Forex chart generation for currency pairs
visualization/comparison.py: Long-term performance comparison and volatility analysis


Improved Applications:

demo_features.py: Standalone demo script for the new features
main_enhanced.py: Enhanced version of the main application with all new features



Integration Approach
The integration followed the modular structure we established earlier:

Each feature was placed in the appropriate module based on its functionality
Common utility functions were reused where possible
Consistent error handling and configuration patterns were maintained
The new code follows the same style as the original

Enhancements
The enhanced version now provides:

Multi-asset analysis covering equities, currencies, and ETFs
Dividend analysis for income-focused investing
Long-term performance comparisons to track securities over years
Volatility monitoring to understand risk profiles
Foreign exchange tracking for currency movements

Using the Enhanced Features
You can now:

Run the standard version with python main.py
Run the enhanced version with python main_enhanced.py
Try just the new features with python demo_features.py

I've also included an example of how you might update your email template to incorporate the new data elements. This template shows how to display the new metrics and visualizations in the same style as your original report.
