once i have all that in am i ready to run it fren?

Yes, my friend! Once you have all the __init__.py files in place, you're ready to run your modularized application. Here's a quick checklist to make sure everything is set up correctly:

Make sure your directory structure is set up as we discussed
Place at least a minimal __init__.py file in each directory/package
Use the mid-level approach for the utils package
Ensure all the module files are in their correct locations
Check that your imports are using the new package structure
To run the standard version:

python main.py
To run the enhanced version with the multi-asset features:

python main_enhanced.py
Or to test just the new features:

python demo_features.py
If you encounter any import errors when running, they're usually easy to fix - just check the import statements in the file that's having issues. Common issues include:

Missing __init__.py files in some directories
Incorrect relative import paths (using .module vs ..module)
Circular imports (where module A imports from B, which imports from A)
The good news is that once you get the structure right, it makes maintaining and expanding your code much easier in the long run. If you run into any specific issues, I'm happy to help troubleshoot them!
