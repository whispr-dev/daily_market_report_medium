model confidence.
How it works: Weighted formula blends signals with adjustable priority (e.g., 40% ML, 20% trend, 20% reversal, 20% confidence).
Use it for: Ranking stocks by total edge — use it to find high-confidence setups, watchlist leaders, or newsletter picks.

🔮 AI Forecast Overlay
What it is: A directional short-term forecast (5-day slope) generated by Ridge regression on recent smoothed prices.
How it works: Trains per ticker on recent data, predicts future trend vector (+/-%) and logs it.
Use it for: Predicting price action before earnings, exits, or re-entries. Overlay this on charts for visual clarity.

⚠️ Reversal Risk Heatmap
What it is: Detects how many tickers show potential tops, bottoms, or neutral patterns based on reversal indicators.
How it works: Uses pattern detection logic (candles, momentum) per stock to classify risk tier.
Use it for: Portfolio risk checks — high-risk clusters suggest hedging or caution; low-risk = possible accumulation zones.

🧊 Autoencoder Anomaly Detection
What it is: A neural net trained to learn "normal" market behavior and flag unusual moves.
How it works: An autoencoder compresses and reconstructs past returns/volatility/volume. High error = anomaly.
Use it for: Spotting stealth breakouts, liquidity shocks, or pre-news moves. Helps front-run volatility.

🧮 Kalman Filter Smoothing
What it is: A probabilistic signal smoother that filters out noise while preserving trend shape.
How it works: Applies a Kalman filter to close prices before they’re used in forecasting or ML scoring.
Use it for: Clean signal generation and trend classification. Avoids fakeouts and whipsaws from noisy candles.

🔁 Regime Detection via HMM
What it is: A model that classifies hidden market states like trend, range, or chop using returns + vol.
How it works: HMM learns latent states and their transitions from historical price data.
Use it for: Dynamic strategy switching — you can trade differently in “state 0” vs “state 2”.

🔮 Bayesian Forecasting
What it is: A probabilistic trend forecast that outputs not just a price target, but a credible interval.
How it works: Fits a Bayesian linear model to recent data, samples 1,000+ futures, and extracts mean + 95% range.
Use it for: Confidence-aware decisions — ideal for newsletters, alerts, or building trust in forecasts.
