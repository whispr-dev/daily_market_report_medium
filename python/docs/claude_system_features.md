That completes all the improvements to your DailyStonks system, woflfren! I've created several artifacts with robust code that should significantly improve the security, performance, and functionality of your system:

Enhanced PayPal Webhook Handler - Added signature verification, proper email handling, and security token generation
Secure Email Sender - Implemented rate limiting, watermarking, and secure unsubscribe tokens
Enhanced Image Utilities - Added better image processing functions including watermarking and optimizations
Subscription Access Control - Created a new module for controlling access to premium content
Enhanced Main Script - Added background tasks, health monitoring, and robust error handling
Improved Welcome Email Template - Added tier-specific content and security features
Gunicorn Configuration - Properly configured your WSGI server for production use

If you want to use background tasks for report generation and email sending, you'll need to install Celery and Redis.

The system should now be much more secure against people trying to bypass your paywalls. The key security features implemented are:

Access Tokens - Secure, time-limited tokens for accessing premium content
Watermarking - Subtle watermarks on charts that identify which subscriber they belong to

RetryClaude hit the max length for a message and has paused its response. You can write Continue to keep the chat going.WcontinueEditLet me continue with additional recommendations and explanations about the security features I've implemented:

Rate Limiting - The email sending system now has rate limiting to prevent abuse
Signature Verification - PayPal webhooks are verified using their signature system
Subscriber IDs - Unique, deterministic IDs for subscribers that can't be guessed

These security measures work together to create a robust system that prevents unauthorized access:

When a user subscribes through PayPal, the webhook handler verifies the signature and generates a secure subscriber ID.
When emails are sent, they include:

A unique, personalized access token embedded in report links
Watermarked images that can be traced back to the subscriber if shared
Secure unsubscribe tokens that can't be forged


When a user tries to access premium content, the system:

Validates their access token
Checks their subscription tier
Verifies they have permission for the requested feature



This multi-layered approach makes it much harder for someone to circumvent your paywall. Even if someone shares a link to a report, the token will expire after a set time (24 hours by default). And if someone shares screenshots, the watermarks can help you identify the source.
Additional security considerations you might want to implement:

IP Tracking - Store the IP address when a user views a report and flag suspicious activity (e.g., a report being viewed from many different IPs)
Device Fingerprinting - Add JavaScript to your report pages to generate a device fingerprint and track if multiple users are sharing an account
Report Versioning - Generate slightly different versions of reports for different users (e.g., subtle changes in formatting or text) to help identify leaked content
CAPTCHA Protection - Add CAPTCHA to your report pages if too many requests come from the same IP

For the email system, I've also implemented:

Queuing - Prevents server overload when sending to many subscribers
Rate Limiting - Avoids triggering anti-spam measures
Error Handling - Properly logs and handles email sending failures

The background task system with Celery allows for:

Scheduled Reports - Generate reports on a schedule (e.g., after market close)
Asynchronous Processing - Handle long-running tasks without blocking web requests
Automatic Cleanup - Remove old reports to save disk space

All of these improvements should make your DailyStonks system more robust, secure, and scalable. Let me know if you need any clarification or have any questions about implementing these changes!
