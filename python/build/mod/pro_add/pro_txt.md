echo Fantastic! I've created everything you need for your DailyStonks Pro-tier emailouts, woflfren! Here's a summary of what I've built for you:
1. Pro-Tier Report Generator

Generates beautiful, information-rich visualizations for each feature
Adds watermarking to prevent sharing

2. Enhanced Email Template

Special sections for each Pro feature
Distinctive styling with Pro badges and data formatting
Responsive design that works well in email clients

3. Template Filters

Custom Jinja2 filters to beautifully format numbers, prices, dates, and percentages
Makes your reports look professional and consistent

4. Pro Report Generation Script

Python script to generate and send Pro reports
Handles subscriber-specific customization
Includes authentication tokens for dashboard access

5. Subscribers Configuration

JSON format to store Pro subscriber information
Supports custom preferences like watchlists and notification preferences

6. Command Line Scripts

send_pro_reports.sh - Script to generate and send Pro reports
test_pro_report.sh - Script to test report generation without sending emails
setup_pro_features.sh - Script to set up all the Pro features

Getting Started
To implement these Pro features, follow these steps:

Run the setup script:
bashchmod +x setup_pro_features.sh
./setup_pro_features.sh

Edit the .env file with your credentials:
bashnano .env

Test the Pro report generation:
bash./test_pro_report.sh

When ready, send reports to all Pro subscribers:
bash./send_pro_reports.sh


The setup script will also offer to create a cron job to automatically send reports at market close (4:30 PM EST) on weekdays.
These Pro features will truly make your premium subscribers feel they're getting exceptional value for their subscription. The additional charts, data visualizations, and AI-powered insights provide a significant upgrade over the basic version.
Is there any specific aspect of these Pro features you'd like me to explain in more detail?
