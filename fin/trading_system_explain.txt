Trading System Implementation Explanation
I've enhanced your daily stonk market report to include approximations of the "Magic Reversal Indicator" and "Elliott Wave Oscillator (EWO)" as described in your fin.txt file. Here's how the implementation matches the trading rules from fin.txt:
K's Reversal Indicator (Magic Reversal Indicator)
From your fin.txt and the images provided, the Magic Reversal Indicator appears to:

Mark potential reversal points with visual indicators
Use a "blue line" as a reference point
Generate buy signals when the indicator appears below the blue line

In our implementation:

We created a detect_reversal_signals() function that identifies potential reversal points based on:

Price momentum changes
Volatility measurement (ATR)
Candlestick patterns


These signals are marked with green triangles (bullish) and red triangles (bearish) on the chart
We added a 20-day moving average as the "blue line" reference

Elliott Wave Oscillator (EWO)
According to fin.txt, the Elliott Wave Oscillator should:

Show green bars when bullish and rising
Show red bars when bearish and falling
Help confirm the reversal signals

Our implementation:

The calculate_ewo() function implements a standard EWO using 5 and 35 period moving averages
Green bars indicate positive EWO values (bullish)
Red bars indicate negative EWO values (bearish)
The oscillator is displayed below the main candlestick chart

Trading Rules Implementation
Your trading rules in fin.txt specify:
Buy Entry Conditions

✅ Magic Reversal Indicator gives a bullish reversal signal
✅ Reversal Indicator mark appears below the Blue line
✅ Elliott Wave Oscillator bar is green and rising
✅ A bullish candle forms after the signal, confirming momentum

Our implementation detects these conditions through:

find_trading_opportunities() function checks for bullish reversal signals
It confirms that the EWO is positive and increasing
It looks for bullish confirmation candles (price closes higher than it opens)

Sell Entry Conditions

✅ Magic Reversal Indicator gives a bearish reversal signal
✅ Elliott Wave Oscillator bar is red and falling
✅ A bearish candle forms after the signal, confirming the downtrend

We detect these through similar logic but for bearish signals.
Key Enhancements Made

Enhanced Candlestick Chart:

Added reversal signals with triangles
Added the "blue line" (20-day MA)
Added EWO histogram below the main chart


Trading Signal Detection:

analyze_technicals() function analyzes each stock
find_trading_opportunities() applies the trading rules
Results are displayed in the email report as "Buy Signals" and "Sell Signals"


Email Template Updates:

Added styled signal boxes for buy and sell signals
Added trade management recommendations (stop loss, risk-reward)
Included the enhanced chart with reversal indicators and EWO



Limitations & Notes

This is an approximation of the proprietary indicators mentioned in your fin.txt
The exact algorithm of K's Reversal Indicator is unknown, so we've implemented a reasonable approximation
The reversal detection sensitivity can be adjusted through parameters
The system works best with daily data, though you mentioned 15-minute charts are recommended in fin.txt

Usage
With these changes, your daily report will now automatically:

Scan for potential buy and sell signals using the trading rules
Show the S&P 500 with reversal indicators and EWO
Present actionable trade ideas with proper risk management guidelines

You can further refine the sensitivity of the indicators by adjusting the parameters in the detect_reversal_signals() and calculate_ewo() functions.
